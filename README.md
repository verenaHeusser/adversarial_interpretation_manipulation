# Fooling Model Manipulations

## Code

There are several emdebbed repos used within the experiments for this work.  
All code samples can be found in the subfolder `code/`.

### MNIST interpretation

Based on \url{https://github.com/owenshen24/interp-exp}.
Used for playing around with hand-defined interpretation methods on the MNIST dataset. 
These examples can seen as war-up technique for getting into the topic of model interpretations. 

1. download data with `./download_mnist_data.sh`
2. Run example notebook ``````

### Fooling Neural Network Interpretations

Code of [Heo et al., 2019] from their official repo \url{https://github.com/rmrisforbidden/Fooling_Neural_Network-Interpretations} in the folder `fooling_neural_network_interpretations`.
