\begin{abstract}
  This paper reviews state-of-the-art approaches to model explanations with a focus on those techniques that try to 
  fool these methods. 

  We don't only want the model to be good. We want it to be safe and interpretable. 
  As machine learning models enter critical areas in human lives such as the criminal justice system, medicine or financial systems, the inability for humans to understand these models is dangerous and problematic. Advances in the rising research area of explainable AI seems to be a remedy. However, there is not yet a consensus about the validity and robustness of explanations methods themselves. The main suggestion of this paper is to be cautious about results of explanation methods. Explanations can be fooled just as the underlying machine learning models. So. in the end the question must be posed whether inexplainable mdoels should be used at all if we need other models to explain these models but are not valid themselves .. % TODO loop structire aufbauen
