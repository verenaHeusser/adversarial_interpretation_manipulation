\section{Conclusion}
Finally, it must be noted that the suitability of a method depends on its application domain. 


Much critique has been applied to methods aiming at interpreting complex and potentially non-interpretable models. 
Some researchers argue it is not worthwhile to study non interpretable systems while dismissing that using inherently interpretable models in the first place might be the better approach. 

Adversarial attacks show that machine learning systems are still fundamentally fragile: They may be successful in a number of tasks, but fail to adapt to ood scenarios, i.e. when being applied to unfamiliar territory.
