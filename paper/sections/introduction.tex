\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This article reviews the current state of the art research in the field of model explanations and model manipulations. 



While most of the approaches to explainability focus on the application to computer vision tasks, other areas are seldomly chosen. 
More importantly, while a big motivation for the development of robust and explainable systems is to overcome biases in models, datasets with 
direct implication of biases are seldomly used and by far not treated as benchmarking scenarios for explainability analyses.
