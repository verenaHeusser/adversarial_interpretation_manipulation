\section{Transferability of Perturbations}
\label(sec:transferability)

input perturbations do not propagate to the whole validation set. 
On the contrary, model manipulations are non-local perturbations, meaning that they do not merely perturb an input sample
but rather effect all samples in the way that the model itself is changed.
