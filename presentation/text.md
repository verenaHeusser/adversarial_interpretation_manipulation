# Omnipresent Machine Learning
- omnipresent: 
 autonomous driving, apps, internet: ml models have reached super human performance on a number of tasks + more and more tasks are being handled

 - performance - complexity: 
 so instead of having a simple model, more complex modes (in terms of number of parameters) are used as they achieve better results


understanding these bb models is hard, even for humans. and mostly, just having a model that preforms well on a held out
test set does not give stakeholders and users enough trust


furthermore, as the application areas are also expanded to more critical areas, such as medicine, politics an even personal rights
the recent discussions an the US on the california 25 cash bail discussions are one example of (as I believe) many more to come
